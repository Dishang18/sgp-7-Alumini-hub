# API Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The frontend was getting 401 errors because many components were still hardcoded to use `http://localhost:5000` instead of the production backend URL from environment variables.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Centralized API Client
- **File**: `Frontend/src/config/apiClient.js`
- **Features**:
  - Uses environment variables automatically
  - Includes `withCredentials: true` by default
  - Request/response interceptors for debugging
  - Proper error handling

### 2. Updated Components
- **Meeting.jsx**: Fixed hardcoded API calls for edit and delete operations
- **Navbar.jsx**: Fixed logout API call
- **UserManagement.jsx**: Updated import to use new API client

### 3. Components Still Need Fixing
The following components still have hardcoded `http://localhost:5000` URLs and need to be updated:

#### High Priority (Authentication Related):
- `Frontend/src/Components/SearchPeople.jsx`
- `Frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` 
- `Frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx`

#### Medium Priority:
- `Frontend/src/Components/NewsletterManager.jsx`
- `Frontend/src/pages/StudentManagement.jsx`
- `Frontend/src/pages/ProfessorAlumniManagement.jsx`

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Current Build
The current build has the critical fixes for Meeting and Navbar components. Deploy this to Netlify to test authentication flow.

### 2. Fix Remaining Components
Update all remaining components to use the new `apiClient` instead of hardcoded axios calls.

### 3. Example Fix Pattern
**Before:**
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/api/endpoint', data, { withCredentials: true });
```

**After:**
```javascript
import apiClient from '../config/apiClient';
await apiClient.post('/api/endpoint', data);
```

## Environment Variables
Ensure these are set correctly:
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://sgp-7-alumini-hub.onrender.com`
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://sgp-7-alumini-hub.onrender.com`

## Testing
After deployment, test:
1. Login functionality
2. Meeting creation/editing
3. Navigation and logout
4. User management (if accessible)

The 401 errors should be resolved for the components that have been updated.
